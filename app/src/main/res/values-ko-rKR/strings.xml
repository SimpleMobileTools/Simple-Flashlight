        A clean flashlight with an extra bright display, customizable stroboscope and a predefined SOS mode.

        All these functions can be hugely helpful under certain circumstances.

        The Bright display can have its color changed, opening a new world of possible uses. It can come handy in case you want to see your wider proximity without blinding yourself.

        The stroboscope can have its frequency changed, ranging from really fast blinking to occasional ones.

        If this free flashlight is turned on via the app (not widget), it will prevent the device from falling asleep. The strong torch can optionally turn on at launching the app, but it isn\'t mandatory.

        Comes with a 1x1 widget with customizable color and transparency.

        It comes with material design and dark theme by default, provides great user experience for easy usage. The lack of internet access gives you more privacy, security and stability than other apps.

        광고가 포함되어 있거나, 불필요한 권한을 요청하지 않습니다. 이 앱의 모든 소스는 오픈소스이며, 사용자가 직접 애플리케이션의 컬러를 설정 할 수 있습니다.
